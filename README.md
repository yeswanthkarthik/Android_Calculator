This readme file is all about the calculator app which I prepared using Android Studio.
The calculator contains different features to calculate the numbers.
The user can calculate the numbers, but there is a 10 digits limit for each operand, there is a toast message for it.
There is a flexibility to calculate DECIMAL numbers.
User can have flexibility to change the operator instead of other.
There is a clear option which can clear all the data and remains “0”.
There is a backspace option to delete the digits which are not required for the user.
The used perform different operations like ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DVIDE and REMAINDER.
It has different characters like +, -, x, /, %, C(clear), backspace, 00 , ., = and digits from 0-9.
User can see clear screen with the data they are entering in the text box.
The UI is aligned properly and the logic was handled using java code (Strings).
The app contains the title with calculator and it is an error free app. Where maximum number of crashes are handled and resolved.
